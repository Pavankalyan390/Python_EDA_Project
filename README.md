# Python_EDA_Project

-  I've build a data analysis project where i analyzed half million sales Transactions from UK based online retailer. And here i make trend analysis, customer segmentation, and also customer churn analysis.
- I analyzed 32 million records using FireDucks library to show that i can analyze large scale of data analysis.
- Right from data loading -> Data cleaning -> Featured Engineering -> Visualization and exploratory data analysis to generate the insights.
